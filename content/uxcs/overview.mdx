  At Zendesk, we have standards
---

This is a guide to write the Zendesk way in product. These standards will eventually live on Garden
but for now, you can find them here. As with all style guides, this is a living document. Leave us
questions and comments below.

## Who should use this

This is for anyone who builds digital experiences for humans. That's a lot of people.
You might be a product manager (PM) looking to reduce confusion about terminology as a product grows.
You might be an interaction designer thinking about the semantic side of a multi-step flow.
Or you could be a writer looking for clear standards and guidelines on the craft of UX Content Strategy.

## Why we wrote this

Visual design and language shape the user experience. The words in your product are like the holds
on a rock climbing wall. Language that's easier to “grasp” makes a product easier to use.

> Language is a way to connect with the people who use your product. When users have a choice (and
> they often do), they choose experiences that make them feel good. In a way that pixels can't,
> language can show empathy, invoke delight, or reassure users when things aren't going well.
