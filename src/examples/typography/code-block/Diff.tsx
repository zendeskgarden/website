 Roses are red,
 Violets are blue,
 Sugar is sweet,
 And so are you.

 Roses are red,
-Violets are blue,
-Iâ€™m unoriginal,
-This is all I can do.
+My screen is blue,
+The system crashed,
+do {} while (true)

 Violets are blue,
-Actually kind of purple,
-Maybe more of a [royal-M400](https://garden.zendesk.com/design/color)?
+TL;DR,
+They differ in hue.
