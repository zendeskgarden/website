## How to use it

### Vertical

Panes can be used in a vertical orientation. The panes resize up to the values
that you set.

### Horizontal

Panes can be used in a horizontal orientation as well.

### Grid

Panes can be resized in both vertical and horizontal directions for a complex
grid flexible layout.

## Customization

### Vertical collapse

Panes can be collapsed or expanded by using the splitter together with an
[Icon button](/components/icon-button). Vertical orientation uses a small circular
icon button positioned on top of the splitter by default in both collapsed and
expanded states. [Tooltips](/components/tooltip) should be used to describe the action.

### Horizontal collapse

Horizontal orientation also uses a small [Icon button](/components/icon-button) to
collapse the pane. When the pane is collapsed, a stretched [Button](/components/button)
is used to indicate an expandable state of the pane.

### Icon button position

Icon button can be positioned at the start, center or on the end of the splitter.
