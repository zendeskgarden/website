title: Dropdowns
description: >
  The `react-dropdowns` package abstracts Menus, Selects, and Autocompletes with a common API.
  They share consistent visuals, common keyboard interactions, and a fully accessible experience
  for sighted and non-sighted users.
---

## Usage

The components in this package must be wrapped with the Dropdown component which provides state and a11y
through the context API to its consumers while enabling customization.

### Placement / Positioning

Internally, the Dropdown component uses [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/) for positioning. Use the
`popperModifiers` prop of the Menu component to customize the placement, boundaries, overflows etc.

### Dropdown State

The [Downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) `render-prop` library handles the keyboard and
accessibility logic. The dropdown component controls these states:

- `isOpen`
- `highlightedIndex`
- `inputValue`
- `selectedItem`
- `selectedItems`

Provide other customizations directly to the Downshift provider via the `downshiftProps` prop. See the
[stateReducer](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statereducer) pattern for an example of a common
customization strategy.

## Server Side Rendering

Server side rendering might require configuring specific Downshift settings. The package mentioned re-exports
the Downshift `resetIdCounter` utility, resetting the internal id counter which is used to generate unique ids
for Downshift.

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query ($fileAbsolutePath: String) {
    ...SidebarPageFragment
  }
`;
