  brand personality, usability, and accessibility in mind. The system is
  broken down into two core palettes: UI and brand.

import { SEO } from '../../components';

export function Head(props) {
  return <SEO {...props} />;
}

## UI colors

The UI colors are used when creating interface elements. Each color has been
designed to meet accessibility requirements.

### Primary colors

Primary colors are used for the structure of interfaces, actionable items,
and validation.

<ColorPalette hues={['grey', 'kale', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'yellow']} />

### Secondary colors

Secondary colors are used in supplementary UI elements such as icons, tags,
status badges, and illustrations.

<ColorPalette
  hues={[
    'purple',
    'royal',
    'fuschia',
    'azure',
    'pink',
    'teal',
    'crimson',
    'mint',
    'orange',
    'lime',
    'lemon'
  ]}
/>

## Brand colors

The brand color palette contains the primary brand colors of Zendeskâ€™s
product suite. These colors are reserved to denote elements in the UI related
to Zendesk products.
