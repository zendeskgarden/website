title: Icon Library
---

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

<!-- ### Tokens

Icon tokens represent specific concepts in Zendesk products.
Before adding an icon to your project, check the list below to see if the concept has an icon token associated with it.
To suggest a new token, please take a look at our [icon token decision tree](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOcPRJo0)
and fill out a Jira template if your request meets the criteria for addition. -->

### All Icons

This is a list of all the icons in the Garden library, independent of context.

<!-- Use these icons only if you can’t find a suitable token. -->

import { SvgSearch } from '../../../examples/design/icons/SvgSearch';

<SvgSearch data={props.data.svgIcons} />

<!-- ### Contributing a token

To suggest a new token, please consider the following:

- Is my token repeatable? If the action will only appear once or very few times, using a one-off icon is fine.

- Will it be used across multiple products?

- Can it be consistently tied with a concept? Is there a clear action?

If you can answer “yes” to these questions, please post in [#garden-seeds](https://app.slack.com/client/T024F4EL1/C02JQBLQX5W/) with the header “Token Request” and the Garden team will get back to you! -->

<!-- ### Contributing an icon

If none of the current Garden icons will work for your token, you can contribute a new icon.

To suggest a new token, please consider the following:

- Is my icon repeatable? Can it be used in at least 3 places?
  If not, consider using a local icon rather than adding to the Garden library.

- Will it be used across mutliple products?

- Is it unique? Is it unlike any exisiting Garden icon?

To suggest an icon, please post in [#garden-seeds](https://app.slack.com/client/T024F4EL1/C02JQBLQX5W/)
with the header “Icon Request,” along with a description of your suggested icon and its associated token. -->
