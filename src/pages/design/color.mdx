description: >
  The Zendesk Garden color system is a set of purposeful colors designed with
  brand personality, usability, and accessibility in mind. The system is
  broken down into two core palettes: UI and brand.
---

## UI colors

The UI colors are used when creating interface elements. Each color has been
designed to meet accessibility requirements.

### Primary colors

Primary colors are used for the structure of interfaces, actionable items,
and validation. Colors in the `600`, `700`, and `800` ranges have a [WCAG
AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
ratio above 4.5:1 against white or `100` backgrounds (excluding
`yellow-600`). The `800` color range has AAA contrast ratios above 7:1
against white and `100` backgrounds.

<ColorPalette hues={['grey', 'kale', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'yellow']} />

### Secondary colors

Secondary colors are used in supplementary UI elements such as icons, tags,
status badges, and illustrations. Each color has a light and dark hue with a
default and muted variant. Muted colors are denoted by an `M` prefix, like
`M400`.

The default color variants should be used for small UI elements when the
design requires a vibrant color. The muted variants are for applications with
larger floods of color like data visualization and infographics. Colors in
the `400` range meet a minimum contrast of 3:1 on white backgrounds
(excluding `lemon` and `lime-400`). Colors in the `600` range meet a 4.5:1
contrast ratio on white backgrounds (excluding `lemon`).

<ColorPalette
  hues={[
    'purple',
    'royal',
    'fuschia',
    'azure',
    'pink',
    'teal',
    'crimson',
    'mint',
    'orange',
    'lime',
    'lemon'
  ]}
/>

## Brand colors

The brand color palette contains the primary brand colors of Zendeskâ€™s
product suite. These colors are reserved to denote elements in the UI related
to Zendesk products.
