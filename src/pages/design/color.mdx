description: >
  The Zendesk Garden color system is a set of purposeful colors designed with
  brand personality, usability, and accessibility in mind. The system is
  broken down into two core palettes: UI and brand.

## UI colors

The UI colors are used when creating interface elements. Each color has been
designed to meet accessibility requirements.

### Primary colors

Primary colors are used for the structure of interfaces, actionable items,
and validation. Colors in the 600, 700, and 800 ranges have a [WCAG
AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
ratio above 4.5:1 against white or 100 backgrounds. The 800 color range
(excluding yellow) has AAA contrast ratios above 7:1 against white and 100
backgrounds.

### Secondary colors

Secondary colors are used in supplementary UI elements such as icons, tags,
status badges, and illustrations. Each color has a light and dark hue with a
default and muted variant. Muted colors are denoted by an "M" prefix, like
M400.

The default color variants should be used for small UI elements when the
design requires a vibrant color. The muted variants are for applications with
larger floods of color like data visualization and infographics. Colors in
the 400 range meet a minimum contrast of 3:1 on white backgrounds. Colors in
the 600 range meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio on white backgrounds.

## Brand colors

The brand color palette contains the primary brand colors of Zendesk’s
product suite. These colors are reserved to denote elements in the UI related
to Zendesk products.
