For calls to action (CTAs), try to be as specific as possible.
This helps the user know exactly what to expect and what they can
do when they interact with the CTA. Use this guide to find the most
appropriate verb for an experience that includes CTAs.

CTAs are most often used in [buttons](/components/button) and [anchors](/components/anchor).

## To make a selection

### Select

Use “Select” when the user must make a decision among multiple options.

## To give a person ownership

### Assign

Use “Assign” when referring to ownership and responsibility.

## To move back and forth

### Back

Use “Back” to take the user to the previous step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [“Next”](#next). In the event that a user will lose changes,
warn them ahead of time that they will lose any changes that have been made.

### Previous

Use “Previous” instead of [“Back”](#back) for pagination in tables.

### Next

Use “Next” to take the user to the next step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [“Back”](#back).

- **Don’t use:** Proceed, Continue

## To postpone action

### Skip

Use “Skip” to allow the user to postpone an action or decision.
It’s a way for the user to avoid interruption and proceed with their current task.

## To receive confirmation

### Done

Use “Done” to confirm the completion of a multi-step process.

- **Don’t use:** OK, Got it, Close

### OK

CTAs make it clear what will happen when a user interacts with it.
“OK” doesn’t do a great job of that. For mobile experiences,
it’s okay to use “OK” but write it as “OK”.

- **Don’t use:** Okay

## To make changes

### Create

Use “Create” when the user is about to make a brand new thing in the product.

### Add

Use “Add” when moving something in the product from one place to another.

- Example: “Add team”, “Add channel”

## To remove

### Clear

Use clear to remove a selection.

- **Don’t use:** Deselect

## To commit

### Save

Use “Save” when the user makes changes and wants to commit them.

## To cancel

### Cancel

Use “Cancel” when the user makes edits but wants to discard them. It dismisses
the page the user was editing and returns the user to the entry point they came from.

- **Don’t use:** Discard changes

### Leave without saving

“Leave without saving” is similar to [“Cancel"](#cancel), with one key difference: it
reverts all values on the page to the last saved state without reloading the page.

- **Don’t use:** Discard changes

### Undo

Revert back to the previous state.

- **Don’t use:** Dismiss, No thanks

## To learn

### Find out more

Use “Find out more” to launch a modal that introduces a new feature.

### Learn about

Use “Learn about” to include a link to the Zendesk help center.
Have the link be a few words about what the user will learn.
Avoid the standalone “Learn more” and help center article titles
that can’t be localized.

- Example: “Learn about user profiles”
- **Don’t use:** Learn more

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query ($fileAbsolutePath: String) {
    ...SidebarPageFragment
  }
`;
