For calls to action (CTAs), try to be as specific as possible.
This helps the user know exactly what to expect and what they can
do when they interact with the CTA. Use this guide to find the most
appropriate verb for an experience that includes CTAs.

CTAs are most often used in [buttons](/components/button) and [anchors](/components/anchor).

## To make a selection

### Select

Use _Select_ when the user must make a decision among multiple options.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Select</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Choose</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To give a person ownership

### Assign

Use _Assign_ when referring to ownership and responsibility.

## To turn on and off

### Turn on

Use _Turn on_ when the user is making something active. Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being turned on.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Turn on</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Enable</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Turn off

Use _Turn off_ when the user is making something inactive. Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being turned off.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Turn off</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Disable</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To move back and forth

### Back

Use _Back_ to take the user to the previous step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [_Next_](#next). In the event that a user will lose changes,
warn them ahead of time that they will lose any changes that have been made.

### Previous

Use _Previous_ instead of [_Back_](#back) for pagination in tables.

### Next

Use _Next_ to take the user to the next step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [_Back_](#back).

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Next</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Proceed, Continue</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To postpone action

### Skip

Use _Skip_ to allow the user to postpone an action or decision.
It’s a way for the user to avoid interruption and proceed with their current task.

## To receive confirmation

### Done

Use _Done_ to confirm the completion of a multi-step process.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Done</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>OK, Got it, Close</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### OK

The best CTAs make it clear what will happen when a user interacts with it.
_OK_ doesn’t do a great job of that but sometimes that's all we need to say.
In general, use _Done_ or a more specific CTA to end an experience. For mobile
experiences, it’s okay to use _OK_ but write it as _OK_ to be concise and align
with most mobile patterns.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>OK</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Okay</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To make changes

### Create

Use _Create_ when the user is about to make a brand new thing in the product.

### Add

Use _Add_ when moving something in the product from one place to another.
For example, “Add team” and “Add channel”.

## To remove

### Clear

Use _Clear_ to remove a selection.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Clear</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Deselect</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To commit

### Save

Use _Save_ when the user makes changes and wants to commit them.

## To cancel

### Cancel

Use _Cancel_ when the user makes edits but wants to discard them. It dismisses
the page the user was editing and returns the user to the entry point they came from.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Cancel</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Discard changes</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Leave without saving

_Leave without saving_ is similar to [_Cancel_](#cancel), with one key difference: it
reverts all values on the page to the last saved state without reloading the page.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Leave without saving</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Discard changes</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Undo

Revert back to the previous state.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Undo</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Dismiss, No thanks</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To learn

### Find out more

Use _Find out more_ to launch a modal that introduces a new feature.

### Learn about

Use _Learn about_ to include a link to the Zendesk help center.
Have the link be a few words about what the user will learn.
For example, “Learn about user profiles”. Avoid the standalone
_Learn more_ and help center article titles that can’t be localized.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Learn about</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Learn more</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>
