For calls to action (CTAs), try to be as specific as possible.
This helps the user know exactly what to expect and what they can
do when they interact with the CTA. Use this guide to find the most
appropriate verb for an experience that includes CTAs.

CTAs are most often used in [buttons](/components/button) and [anchors](/components/anchor).

## To make a selection

### Select

Use _Select_ when the user must make a decision among multiple options.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Select</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Choose</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To give a person ownership

### Assign

Use _Assign_ when referring to ownership and responsibility.

## To turn on and off

### Activate (_Active_)

Use _Activate_ when the user is making something active so it operates on its own.
Things like triggers, automations, and deletion schedules that the user creates.
Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being activated. For example, "Activate trigger".
When something is activated, its status is _Active_.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Activate</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Enable</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Deactivate (_Inactive_)

Use _Deactivate_ when the user is making something inactive and therefore,
stops it from operating on its own. Things like triggers, automations, and deletion schedules
that the user creates. Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being deactivated.
For example, “Deactivate trigger”. When something is deactivated, its status is _Inactive_.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Deactivate</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Disable</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Turn on (_On_)

Use _Turn on_ when the user is making a feature or function available.
Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being turned on. For example, “Turn on messaging for your account”.
When something is turned on, its status is _On_. More often than not, you don't need to say “turn on”
at the front of every phrase, especially if it's implied like checking a checkbox.
See if you can say what you mean without it.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Turn on</p>
    <p>Automatically delete PII</p>
    <p>Turn on access log API</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Enable</p>
    <p>Turn on automatic PII deletion</p>
    <p>Let access log API send me data</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Turn off (_Off_)

Use _Turn off_ when the user is making a feature or function unavailable.
This is to reverse their original decision to turn it on.
Follow it with a noun to clarify what is being turned off.
For example, “Turn off Agent Workspace”. When something is turned off, its status is _Off_.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Turn off</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Disable</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To move back and forth

### Back

Use _Back_ to take the user to the previous step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [_Next_](#next). In the event that a user will lose changes,
warn them ahead of time that they will lose any changes that have been made.

### Previous

Use _Previous_ instead of [_Back_](#back) for pagination in tables.

### Next

Use _Next_ to take the user to the next step in a multi-step process.
Pair this with [_Back_](#back).

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Next</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Proceed, Continue</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To postpone action

### Skip

Use _Skip_ to allow the user to postpone an action or decision.
It’s a way for the user to avoid interruption and proceed with their current task.

## To receive confirmation

### Done

Use _Done_ to confirm the completion of a multi-step process.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Done</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>OK, Got it, Close</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### OK

The best CTAs make it clear what will happen when a user interacts with it.
_OK_ doesn’t do a great job of that but sometimes that's all we need to say.
In general, use _Done_ or a more specific CTA to end an experience. For mobile
experiences, it’s okay to use _OK_ but write it as _OK_ to be concise and align
with most mobile patterns.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>OK</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Okay</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To make changes

### Create

Use _Create_ when the user is about to make a brand new thing in the product.

### Add

Use _Add_ when the user can layer on additional things to something that has
already been created. For example, before adding conditions to a trigger,
the user must _[Create](#create)_ the trigger.

### Edit

Use _Edit_ when the user can modify an existing item such as data.
The user can only change that particular item and can’t perform other
actions like _[Add](#add)_ or _Delete_.

### Manage

Use _Manage_ when the user can control a large area or thing such as a
subscription or a team. Unlike _[Edit](#edit)_, the user can complete
a variety of other actions such as _[Add](#add)_ and _[Delete](#delete)_. The scope of
the changes for _Manage_ is also larger compared to _Edit_.

### Update

Use _Update_ in billing and app changes. In other areas of the product,
use _[Save](#save)_ or _[Edit](#edit)_.

## To remove

### Clear

Use _Clear_ to remove a selection.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Clear</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Deselect</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Delete

Use _Delete_ when the user is about to get rid of something permanently.
When a user deletes a layout, it’s gone forever and the user can’t get it back.
The opposite of _Delete_ is [_Create_](#create) when the user makes something new.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Delete</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Remove, Archive</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Remove

Use _Remove_ when the user is getting rid of something but has the option to add it back later.
For example, when a user removes an app from their workspace, it can still be found in their list of apps.
The opposite of _Remove_ is [_Add_](#add) when the user wants to bring it back.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Remove</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Delete, Archive</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Archive

Use _Archive_ to unpublish content like a help center article.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Archive</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Remove, Delete</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To commit

### Save

Use _Save_ when the user makes changes and wants to commit them.

## To make public

### Share

Use _Share_ when the user wants to make things visible internally.
For example, a user can share a dashboard with their team members.

### Publish

Use _Publish_ when the user wants to make things visible externally.
For example, a user publishes an article to the help center.
To hide the article from public view, the user can _Unpublish_ it.

## To cancel

### Cancel

Use _Cancel_ when the user makes edits but wants to discard them. It dismisses
the page the user was editing and returns the user to the entry point they came from.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Cancel</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Discard changes</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Leave without saving

_Leave without saving_ is similar to [_Cancel_](#cancel), with one key difference: it
reverts all values on the page to the last saved state without reloading the page.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Leave without saving</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Discard changes</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Undo

Revert back to the previous state.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Undo</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Dismiss, No thanks</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## To learn

### Learn about

Use _Learn about_ to include a link to the Zendesk help center.
Have the link be a few words about what the user will learn.
For example, “Learn about user profiles”. Avoid the standalone
_Learn more_ and help center article titles that can’t be localized.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Learn about</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Learn more</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>
