title: Voice and tone

## How to sound like Zendesk

Our product is an extension of our brand and we want it to feel like Zendesk. We use visual design
to shape what Zendesk looks like, and voice and tone to shape what Zendesk sounds like.

| Voice      | Tone       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| About us   | About them |
| Consistent | Variable   |

While brand voice is typically unchanging, a brand's tone varies across each user experience. A
system failure isn’t the right time to be charming. And using a distilled tone could make an
onboarding experience feel cold and unwelcoming.

## Tone Framework

The Zendesk tone framework can help determine which brand tone to use and when. To create this
framework we plotted dozens of user interactions across two dimensions.

- Informational vs instructional
- Low impact vs high impact

## What these dimensions mean

### Informational

Information for the user to know. They don't have to act on this content, but it is useful for their
workflow.

### Instructional

Instructions for a user to learn or act on. This content generally requires more attention to
understand.

### Low impact

It's useful but not indispensable. Even if a user skimmed this content, they could safely navigate
the product.

### High impact

This stuff really matters. Whether good news or bad, this content has a direct impact on a user's
success in the product.

## Mapping tone

After plotting these user interactions, we outlined four quadrants that were a natural fit for our
brand tones.

### Low impact and informational

Contextual feedback to help the user. This content appears right when the user needs it: in
labels, tooltips, and auto-dismissing alerts. It's good to know, but not to remember.

| Tone to use                            | Character            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Distilled:** Space, precise, focused | An efficient surgeon |

What surgeons know: precise action takes precise communication. Use the Distilled tone to say it quickly
and clearly. Nuance and charm get in the way of transactional experiences or basic user feedback.

### High impact and informational

These are mindful memos to our user, not directives. Warnings and unsaved changes modals tell our
users something is up, but leave it up to the user to decide how to act.

| Tone to use                               | Character         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Humblident:** Even, Calm, Knowledgeable | A resolute sherpa |

The sherpa knows the way up the mountain, but you’re the one who climbs it. Zendesk’s Humblident
tone (a proprietary mix of ‘humble’ and ‘confident’) is how we empower users to make choices. We
don’t ask “Are you sure?” because informed users know what’s right for them.

### High impact and instructional

These are mindful memos to our user, not directives. Warnings and unsaved changes modals tell our
users something is up, but leave it up to the user to decide how to act.

| Tone to use                          | Character          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Real:** Direct, Candid, Respectful | Your no B.S bestie |

We love our no B.S. besties because they say what needs to be said—even the hard stuff—from a place
of empathy. Use the Real tone whenever there’s potential for disappointment. Deprecated feature?
Hacked account? Skip the sugar-coated corp-speak and never make jokes. Real is the sweet spot
between Charming and Distilled: tell it like it is.

### Low impact and Instructional

Actionable but adjacent to key user flows. Onboarding and empty states are cool, but not mandatory
to get work done. Content’s job is to make these experiences worthwhile and delightful for the user.

| Tone to use                                | Character    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Charming:** Refreshing, Warm, Well-timed | A great host |

A great host knows the right thing to say and how to say it. A sprinkle of Charming tone adds warmth
(and umami) to the product. It’s perfect for low-stakes interactions where the user has more time to
read and less to do. But don’t overdo it. The goal is a smile, not a LMFAO. We’re here to serve, not
entertain.
