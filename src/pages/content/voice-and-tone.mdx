## How to sound like Zendesk

Our product is an extension of our brand and we want it to feel like Zendesk. We use visual design
to shape what Zendesk looks like, and voice and tone to shape what Zendesk sounds like.

| Voice      | Tone       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| About us   | About them |
| Consistent | Variable   |

While brand voice is typically unchanging, a brand's tone varies across each user experience. A
system failure isn’t the right time to be charming. And using a distilled tone could make an
onboarding experience feel cold and unwelcoming.

## Tone Framework

The Zendesk tone framework can help determine which brand tone to use and when. To create this
framework we plotted dozens of user interactions across two dimensions.

- Informational vs instructional
- Low impact vs high impact

### Informational

Information for the user to know. They don't have to act on this content, but it is useful for their
workflow.

### Instructional

Instructions for a user to learn or act on. This content generally requires more attention to
understand.

### Low impact

Useful but not indispensable. Even if a user skimmed this content, they could safely navigate the
product.

### High impact

Stuff that really matters. Whether good news or bad, this content has a direct impact on a user's
success in the product.

## Mapping tone

After plotting these user interactions, we outlined four quadrants that were a natural fit for our
brand tones.

### Low impact and informational

**Tone to use:** Distilled

**Character:** An efficient surgeon

| What users expect                                                                                                                                                       | How to sound Distilled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contextual useful feedback. This content appears right when the user needs it: in labels, tooltips, and auto-dismissing alerts. It’s good to know, but not to remember. | Distilled means spare, precise, and focused.<br/><br/>What surgeons know: precise action takes precise communication. Use the Distilled tone to say it quickly and clearly. Nuance and charm can get in the way of transactional experiences or basic user feedback. |

### High impact and informational

**Tone to use:** Humblident

**Character:** A resolute sherpa

| What users expect                                                                                                                                                             | How to sound Humblident                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mindful memos to our user, not directives. Warnings and unsaved changes modals tell our users something is up, but leave it up to them to decide their best course of action. | Humblident means even, calm, and knowledgeable.<br/><br/>The sherpa knows the way up the mountain, but you’re the one who climbs it. Zendesk’s Humblident tone (a proprietary mix of ‘humble’ and ‘confident’) is how we empower users to make choices. We don’t ask “Are you sure?” because informed users know what’s right for them. |

### High impact and instructional

**Tone to use:** Real

**Character:** Your no-B.S. best friend

| What users expect                                                                                                                                                                              | How to sound Real                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concepts to learn and act upon. A failure or security breach email, for example. The content goes beyond information; it must assure and guide the user to the best course of action for them. | Real means direct, candid, and respectful.<br/><br/>We love our no B.S. besties because they say what needs to be said—even the hard stuff—from a place of empathy. Use the Real tone whenever there’s potential for disappointment. Deprecated feature? Hacked account? Skip the sugar-coated corp-speak and never make jokes. Real is the sweet spot between Charming and Distilled: tell it like it is. |

### Low impact and instructional

**Tone to use:** Charming

**Character:** A fastidious host

| What users expect                                                                                                                                                                                   | How to sound Charming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actionable but not imperative content. Onboarding and empty states are cool, but not mandatory to get work done. Content’s job is to make these experiences worthwhile and delightful for the user. | Charming means refreshing, warm, and well-timed.<br/><br/>A great host knows the right thing to say and how to say it. A sprinkle of Charming tone adds warmth (and umami) to the product. It’s perfect for low-stakes interactions where the user has more time to read and less to do. But don’t overdo it. The goal is a smile, not a LMFAO. We’re here to serve, not entertain. |
