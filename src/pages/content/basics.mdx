## Active voice

Active voice is how people speak in everyday conversation. It’s simpler and results in shorter
sentences. Avoid using passive voice because it sounds formal and wordy. To write in active
voice make the subject of the sentence do the action.

Passive voice often has this construction: The _object_ was _verb-ed_. Sometimes for brevity we
use something closer to passive voice but this usually happens in confirmation or
success notifications.

## Jargon

Zendesk doesn’t speak jargon. Use Plain Language instead. Jargon is confusing, difficult to translate,
and can feel downright icky. It can also result in non-inclusive language, which goes against
our values. Replace jargon with plain language and define acronyms on first use.

We now support a _wide_ variety of **styles** and `inline code` syntaxes.

## Metaphor and analogy

Metaphors and analogies make new or complicated concepts easier to understand by
connecting them to everyday ideas. Some tips on using metaphor and analogy:

- Use them sparingly. The UI shouldn’t be flooded with metaphors. Don’t use a metaphor if it makes
  things more confusing.
- Avoid using a metaphor in a page description or page title. That space is
  reserved for clear labels, definitions, and action-oriented copy, not concepts.
- Metaphors are annoying if seen over and over again. Consider using them
  in short-lived, highly contextual, or supplementary UI experiences like an
  onboarding flow, help documentation, or a tooltip.

## Plain language

For content that’s understood by the widest possible audience, aim for an eighth grade reading level.
Test content readability using Hemingway App, Grammarly, or Storytoolz.
To make writing readable use simple words and short sentences with fewer clauses.

import { graphql } from 'gatsby';

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query($fileAbsolutePath: String) {
    ...SidebarPageFragment
  }
`;
