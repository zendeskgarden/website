## Five things to remember

### Write for everyone

Copy that relies on visual descriptions (like shapes, color, or location in the UI), makes it
difficult for people who use screen readers. Be mindful of gendered pronouns and ableist language
too. We write for everyone.

### Use the active voice

The active voice is simpler and shorter. To write in the active voice make the subject of the
sentence do the action. "You created an account” instead of "An account was created."

### Be clear, not clever

Metaphors and analogies can make complicated concepts easier to understand, but don't use them
everywhere. They are effective in places the user doesn't see very often (onboarding flows, modals),
but can be distracting when overdone.

### Avoid jargon at all costs

Zendesk doesn’t speak jargon. Specialized terminology and buzzwords are confusing and difficult to
translate. Replace jargon terms ("seamless," "pipeline") with plain language instead.

### Use plain language

Plain language means simple words and short sentences with fewer clauses. We aim for an eighth grade
reading level in product language. Test readability with free tools like [Hemingway
App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Storytoolz](https://storytoolz.com/readability).
