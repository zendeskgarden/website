## Words we use

### @mention

Pronounced “at mention.” Always lowercase, even at the beginning of a sentence.

### accessible, accessibility, a11y

Describes a set of standards that make our product usable to people experiencing
disabilities. Avoid using accessible as a synonym for “simple.” For that
purpose, use terms like easy to learn, easy to use, or intuitive.

### add

Use _add_ when moving a “thing” in the product from one place to another.

- Compare with [assign](/content/word-list#assign), [create](/content/word-list#create)

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a user to a group.</li>
      <li>Assign user to a group.</li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <ul>
      <li>Assign a ticket to this agent.</li>
      <li>Add this ticket to the agent.</li>
    </ul>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### assign

Use _assign_ when referring to ownership and responsibility.

- Compare with [add](/content/word-list#add), [create](/content/word-list#create)

### create

Use _create_ when you’re about to make a brand new thing in the product.

- Compare with [add](/content/word-list#add)

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Create object record.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Add a new object record.</p>
  </Dont>

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

### aka, a.k.a.

Stands for also known as. Instead of a.k.a., use aka with no punctuation.

### add-on, addon

Use _add-on_. Lowercase, with hyphen.

### all of

Redundant. Just say all.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>It lists all your customers.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>It lists all of your customers.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### among, between

Use _among_ when referring to 3 or more persons (or things).

- Compare with [between](/content/word-list#between)

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>You can share tickets among members of your group.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>You can share tickets among you and your admin.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### and/or

Avoid this construction. Use either _and_ or _or_ by itself.

### Answer Bot

Two words, title case.

### any time, anytime

The two-word _any time_ is always the safer choice. If you do use the one-word
form, anytime, make sure it's an adverb. If you need to say, “At any time,” it
must be two words.

### app, apps

Use lowercase for general references. Don’t capitalize for emphasis. Capitalize
only when referring to a feature, such as _Zendesk Apps_. When referring to the
Zendesk app marketplace use _Zendesk Marketplace_.

### appears, displays

_Displays_ is a transitive verb, meaning that the action transfers to something
else. For example, "a screen displays an image." While _displays_ requires a direct
object, _appears_ does not. For example, "an image appears on screen."

### as

Avoid using _as_ as a synonym for "because" or "while." While grammatically
correct, these uses make reading more difficult for a global audience.

- Compare with [because](/content/word-list#because-since)

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Use the active voice whenever possible because it’s easier to translate.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Use the active voice whenever possible as it is easier to translate.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### because, since

Use _because_ instead of "since." Using since can cause problems with machine
translation. Use _because_ to refer to the reason for something, and reserve
_since_ to refer to a passage of time.

### between

Use _between_ when referring to 2 persons (or things) or when referring to
relationships between two items at a time, regardless of the total number of
items.

- Compare with [among](/content/word-list#among)

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Move between the two tickets at the top of the list.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Move between several tickets on the page.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### blacklist, whitelist

Avoid this usage. Use _blocked_ and _allowed_ instead.

### CC, CCs, CCed

In the product, use uppercase. OK to use as a noun ("the CC", "the CCs"), as a
transitive verb ("CC me"), or as an adjective ("the CCed agent").

In documentation, it’s permitted to use lowercase and apostrophes (cc, cc’s,
cc’ed).

### channel

Use lowercase for general references. Capitalize when referring to the
_Channel framework_ or describing features of the framework, such as
the _Channel pull endpoint_.

### chat, Zendesk Chat

Lowercase when talking about a chat message or the verb. Capitalize when
referring to the feature or the product, such as _Zendesk Chat_.

### choose, select

Use _choose_ when the user makes a decision or action. Use _select_ when the user is
considering a list of items.

### click, swipe, tap

Avoid using platform-specific words like _click_, _swipe_, or _tap_.

Use _click_ to describe the action of pressing a key, mouse, or button. For mobile
or screen-based physical contact, use _tap_. Pair click directly with the button
or menu label without “on” or “at.”

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Preview document</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Click on preview</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Customer Support

Use _Zendesk Customer Support_ or _Customer Support_ when referring to the place
Zendesk customers go for support on our product. Avoid Support team.

### CSAT

All caps. Short for customer satisfaction. Use only as an adjective, as in
_CSAT rating_ or _CSAT survey_.

### data

Always use _data_ with a singular verb. In other words, “The data is unavailable.”
If you want to emphasize that something is plural, rewrite to use a term such as
facts or numbers.

### data center

_Data center_ is always two words.

### deselect, cancel

Use _clear_ or _cancel_ instead of "deselect." As in, “Clear these checkboxes”
or “Cancel this selection.”

### done

Avoid _done_ since it doesn’t provide enough information. Button labels should
make it clear what’s going to happen when the user clicks.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>
      Description: Settings updated <br />
      Button label: Go to Admin Center
    </p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>
      Description: Settings updated
      <br />
      Button label: Done
    </p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### drop-down

This noun describes a UI element that lets users pick from a series of options.
Always hyphenate it.

### for example, e.g.

Keep it conversational by using _for example_. The scholarly way to say “for
example” is using “e.g.,” which stands for _exempli gratia_.

### either

Use _either_ only for a decision between two choices.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>You may choose either bacon or tofu.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>You may choose either bacon, snake meat, or tofu.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### email, emails

No hyphen needed.

### feedback

Use _give feedback_ or for some Early Access Program (EAP)
links, _share your thoughts_.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Give feedback</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Provide feedback</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### full and fully

Avoid _full_ and _fully_ unless you’re writing marketing copy.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>Full-featured agent workflow</li>
      <li>Full ticket history</li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully customizable</li>
      <li>Full live chat software functionality</li>
    </ul>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### greater, better

Avoid using subjective terms when talking about system requirements or versions.
Use objective terms instead.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>Update to the latest version of Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Chat requires Microsoft Edge v.14 or higher</li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <ul>
      <li>Update to the best version of Explore</li>
      <li>Chat requires Microsoft Edge v.14 or better</li>
    </ul>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Help Center

Capitalize both words. Also, refer to it as _Help Center_, not _the Help Center_.

Example: "Edit articles in Help Center."

A possessive pronoun is OK.

Example: “Edit articles in your Help Center.”

### help desk

Zendesk makes customer service software, not help desk software. The term
_help desk_ should only be used when specifically addressing IT or help desk issues.

In most cases, you can use _Zendesk Support_ instead.

Example: "You can use Zendesk Support to improve your relationship with your
customers."

### hint

Don’t use it as a heading for a type of note. Use _tip_ instead.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

### i.e.

Abbreviation for _id est_, meaning “that is.” Use _that is_ or _in other words_
instead.

### incoming, outgoing

Use to refer to email messages that are being downloaded or being sent. Do not
use inbound and outbound unless you have no other choice.

### Insights

Capitalize when referring to the Zendesk product.

### JavaScript

Use [Pascal case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). Not Javascript or javascript.

### knowledge base

Two words, lowercase. Sometimes called KB for short.

### Learn about vs. learn more

We reserve the linked words _Learn about_ to begin links to the Zendesk Help
Center. Avoid the standalone "Learn more" to prevent the repetition of the
phrase in screen readers. Include a few short words about what the user will
learn.

- Use this formula: "Learn about [linked subject]”
- Aim for a maximum of four words per link
- Avoid Help Center article names that can’t be localized

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Learn about user profiles</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Learn more</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### macOS

Use when referring to the operating system. Don't use Mac OS.

### min, max

It’s better to spell these out in full (“minimum” or “maximum”) but the short
form is OK when you’re short on space. You don’t need a period after min or max.

### Net Promoter Score℠, NPS®

Uppercase. Use trademark symbols on first reference. _Net Promoter Score_ is a
service mark (℠); _NPS_ is a registered trademark (®). Symbols should be placed
directly after the mark, in superscript, and slightly smaller than the mark
text.

### new

_New_ requires gender for many languages. _Add_ is a better substitute. Features
that are new to the user are best communicated through emails, landing pages,
and marketing materials.

### OK

Avoid _OK_ as a button label. Button labels should make it clear what’s going to
happen when the user clicks it. Never use "Okay."

On mobile devices it’s permitted to use OK for button text.

### OAuth

Not oAuth.

### on, onto

You record conversations _on_ a ticket rather than onto. Onto conveys actual
motion. For example, I jumped onto the parallel bars. If you’re confused, just
say "up" before on in the sentence. If it makes sense, onto is the right word.

### plan, account

Don’t use account to refer to Zendesk _plans_.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>The Enterprise plan supports light agents.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>The Enterprise account supports light agents.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### plugin

No hyphen.

### product tray

Use _products icon_ instead.

### register vs. sign up

Use _register_ instead.

### self-service

Always hyphenate.

### set up, setup

Two words (set up) for the verb, one word (setup) for the adjective or as a
noun.

### sign in, sign out

Use _sign in_ and _sign out_ instead of "log in", and "log out". Hyphenate as an
adjective or as a noun.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Sign in</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Log in</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### single sign-on (SSO)

Hyphenate sign-on and spell this out on first use.

### spam

Don’t use _spam_ as a verb.

### subdomain

One word.

### subscription

For a person’s Zendesk account only. Not for individual plans or products.

### support, Support

Capitalize when referring to the Zendesk Support product. Use lowercase
otherwise.

### Support team

Don’t use. Use _Zendesk Customer Support_ or _Customer Support_ instead.

### stats

Used in Help Center articles and in reports. Abbreviation OK.

### thank you, thanks

Reserve _thank you_ and _thanks_ for times when users provide information that’s
difficult or inconvenient to collect.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Thank you for submitting a request.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Thank you for changing your settings.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### ticket, ticket form

Lowercase for both. Don’t capitalize for emphasis.

### trigger

Lowercase.

### user name

Two words. Not hyphenated.

### website, web form, web page

All lowercase.

### Web Widget

Capitalize both words.

### workflow

One word.

### Zendesk

Always capitalize the name of our company. Never use ZenDesk or give it an
apostrophe. We’re not the possessive type.

### Zendesk Apps

Capitalize this feature name: _The Zendesk Apps_ framework.

<hr />

## Words we avoid

These words aren’t bad. They’re just not in our terminology diet.

### oops, whoops, oh no

Oops, we did it again. Seriously, though, we don’t use _oops_ or other
self-deprecating blurts in error messages or empty states.

### please

That’s right. At Zendesk, you can skip the P-word. It takes up space in our UI
and can come across as insincere.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Your password was reset. Enter a new password.</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Your password was reset. Please enter a new password.</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### sorry

We generally don’t apologize when things go wrong. When there’s an error, tell
the user what happened and give them clear directions on what they can do next.

Instead we save apologies for meaningful situations: when something goes really
wrong or when Zendesk as a company has made a serious error, like deleting an
account.

### we

Avoid _we_ unless referring to a specific group of people. Don’t use _we_ to refer
to Zendesk the company or Zendesk the software. Similarly, avoid using _our_. See
[Pronouns](/content/grammar#pronouns).

<hr />

## People

The people in our Zendesk neighborhood. All of the people in the neighborhood
have a job to do.

### account owner

An _account owner_ is a type of administrator. The account name is associated with
this person's name, usually the person who created the account. Just like "The
Highlander," there can be only one. For example, “Only the account owner has
permission to make subscription changes.”

### admin, administrator

_Admins_ have additional access to the Zendesk experience like setting up the
workflows, adding users, and defining automations. We recommend _admins_ instead
of _administrators_. It’s friendlier and shorter. For example, “Allow admins to
tag users.”

Avoid telling agents to “talk to an admin.” Instead, inform them that an admin
can do the task and leave the communication up to the agent. For example, “You
don’t have Explore. An admin can activate that in your subscription.”

### advisor

In Support Enterprise, _advisors_ manage the workflow and configure the Zendesk
experience. Advisors don't solve tickets and they can only make private comments
or add notes.

### agent

_Agents_ are the bulk of the support staff for Zendesk subscribers. They’re
assigned tickets and interact with their customers to resolve issues. For
example, “Zendesk Support offers several tools to make your agents more
efficient.”

### customer

Often synonymous with _end user_, but not all Zendesk subscribers think of their
end users as _customers_. For example, the end users of an IT department are
employees. Use _subscriber_ to refer to people and organizations with a paid
subscription to Zendesk.

### editor

_Editors_ can create and customize new dashboards, queries, and datasets. (Explore only.)

### end user

Not hyphenated when used as a noun. Hyphenated when used as an adjective or
modifier. For example, “This access point is for the end user” and “This is an
end-user access point.”

### manager

_Managers_ have full privileges in Guide. All admins have Guide manager
privileges, including access to all content. For example, “You must be a Guide
manager to create user segments."

### rep

This is for Sell only.

### seat

When you’re adding more space to an account, you’re adding or filling _seats_.
Seats can be used across all products. For example, “You can add more agents by
purchasing additional agent seats.”

### staff

In Support Enterprise and Admin Center, _staff_ is similar to agent. Staff can
edit and solve tickets, view reports, and add or edit personal views and macros.
In Explore Enterprise, staff means a viewer who can see dashboards but cannot
create or edit dashboards. (Support Enterprise, Explore Enterprise, and Admin
Center only.)

### subscriber

The people who have a paid subscription with Zendesk. This is in contrast to
_end users_: the customers of our _subscribers_ who don’t pay to use our
products.

### team leader

_Team leaders_ have more access to Zendesk products than staff agents. They can
read and edit all tickets and moderate forums. They can also create and edit end
users, groups, and organizations. (Support Enterprise only.)

### user

Admin, agent, end user, subscriber, website visitor, trialer: We have a lot of
types. _User_ is fine, but be role-specific wherever possible.

### viewer

_Viewer_ is used across all products. It refers to users who can see dashboards
but can’t edit or create them.
