## Acronyms and abbreviations

Acronyms are like inside jokes. If you aren’t in the know they don’t make sense. Use acronyms to
save space, but not at the risk of confusing people. Spell out an acronym on first use and include
it in parentheses. ​

_A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract between you and your customers._

## Bold and italics

Use bold to refer to UI elements. Avoid italics or quotation marks. Using bold is a bold statement.
A little bit goes a long way, so use bold sparingly. Don't get too bold in notifications. Only use
bold for headings, and not in the description.

## Capitalization

Follow [standard capitalization
rules](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.html) for English.
Capitalize names of people, companies, and product features and use lowercase for just about
everything else. At Zendesk, we use [sentence
case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case) for headings, subheadings, and
buttons.

## Contractions

Contractions are A-OK. They make sentences shorter and easier to read. Avoid them in flows that feel
formal like billing, security settings, or account recovery.

## Date and time

Use unicode standards for date and time. Refer to your location-specific standards on CLDR. Zendesk
uses relative time to show elapsed time. Avoid vague terms like “now,” “soon,” “later,” or“in a
while.”

| When the event happened                             | Example                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Less than a minute ago today.                       | < 1 minute ago                |
| More than a minute and less than an hour ago today. | 43 minutes ago<br/>43 min ago |
| More than an hour ago today.                        | Today at {'{time}'}           |
| On the previous calendar date.                      | Yesterday at {'{time}'}       |
| Before yesterday and in the current calendar year.  | {'{date}'} at {'{time}'}      |
| Any time before the current year.                   | {'{date}'} at {'{time}'}      |

## Emoji

Save it for Slack. Emoji are rarely used in the UI. Some emojis have double meanings and don’t
localize. 👎 😞

## Numbers and currency

Use unicode standards for numbers and currency. Refer to your location-specific standards on CLDR.
Zendesk uses numerals (rather than words) in the UI. Recast descriptions to avoid starting a
sentence with a number.

## Pronouns

Using Zendesk is a gender-neutral experience. Instead of gendered pronouns, rewrite using second
person (“you”), or “they” and “their.”​

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>If the end user isn’t online, they will get an email instead.</p>
  </Do>
</BestPractice>

### You

Address a single person in a specific context, rather than all people. UX is a conversation, not a
speech.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>You don’t have access</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Access denied</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Me

Don’t put words in our users' mouths. They can speak for themselves. Avoid using my, us, and mine.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Skip</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Remind me later</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### We

Frame experiences around the user. Only use “we” when a specific group of humans are the authors of
a message, for example, "We're the UX Research team and we want your feedback."

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Check your inbox for an email confirmation</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>We'll send you an email confirmation</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## Singular and plural

Use singular to represent a quantity of one and plural for two or more things. Avoid parentheses to
display both cases at once.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <p>Add user</p>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <p>Add user(s)</p>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

## Tense

The present tense is what’s happening now. It’s friendlier and easier to read. Stick to one tense
per component. Don’t move from past to present tense—we’re not time travelers.

<BestPractice>
  <Do>
    <ul>
      <li>Message sent</li>
      <li>Chat ended</li>
      <li>Chat will end</li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <ul>
      <li>Message has been sent</li>
      <li>Chat has ended</li>
      <li>Chat will have ended</li>
    </ul>
  </Dont>
