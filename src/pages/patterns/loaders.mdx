## Overview

Different loaders are used to communicate structure and context of the content being loaded,
each one tailored to a specific use case.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Component</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/components/skeleton">Skeleton</a>
      </td>
      <td>Default loader. Used when the content on the page is known or predictable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/components/spinner">Spinner</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Used as an alternative to the Skeleton loader when the content is unknown or unpredictable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/components/dots">Dots</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Used inside the interface to represent a busy state. For example, inside buttons,
        asynchronous loading menus, or other small components.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/components/progress">Progress</a>
      </td>
      <td>Used for communicating progress from 0 to 100%.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/components/inline">Inline</a>
      </td>
      <td>Reserved for typing indicators.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Usage

### Predictable content

When loading pages or parts of pages with predictable layout, <a href="/components/skeleton">Skeleton loader</a>
is used to show a blank stand-in version of the component that has not fully loaded. It provides a visual estimate of
the space needed. This is the preferred loader in most situations as it provides a sense of progress, helps orient the
user, and sets expectations on the type of content they can expect.

![Example of skeleton loaders for predictable content](figma:patterns-loaders-skeleton-predictable.png)

The size of the loader should approximately reflect the content it represents. Show a few skeleton loaders to orient
the user, but don’t map out every element even if a page has a lot of content. Mapping out skeleton loaders in the
first few elements of the header/body area are enough to convey the loading process.

Loader animation has a built-in short delay which should give time for the fast loading content to show before the
loader becomes visible. Loader should be persistent until the content is fully loaded.

Use default skeleton loaders on white or light backgrounds. Use light skeleton loaders on dark backgrounds.

<BestPractice>
  <Do
    imageIsFreeForm
    imageSource={props.data.LoadersSkeletonDo.childFile.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData}
    alt="A few skeleton loaders to orient the user"
  >
    <ul>
      <li>Show a skeleton loader to orient the user.</li>
    </ul>
  </Do>
  <Dont
    imageIsFreeForm
    imageSource={props.data.LoadersSkeletonDont.childFile.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData}
    alt="Too many skeleton loaders"
  >
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid mapping every line with a skeleton loader.</li>
    </ul>
  </Dont>
</BestPractice>

### Unpredictable content

A <a href="/components/spinner">Spinner loader</a> is used when content is unknown or unpredictable. Spinner appears
before a page is loaded to assure a user that the content is on its way. Use spinners for pages and screens or within
components such as tables. Center the spinner in the container or content you’re applying it to. Spinner is also used
as an alternative loader to Skeleton in situations where the content can't be easily estimated but it's still
important to provide a sense of progress.

### Completing action

The <a href="/components/dots">Dots loader</a> communicates ongoing activity after a user takes an action. It tells
them that something is taking place. Dots loader is used for buttons, search inputs, or other small components to
indicate these components are doing something.

Use the loader for actions where it might take several seconds for the process to complete.

![Example of dot loaders when completing an action](figma:patterns-loaders-completing-action.png)

1. <a href="/components/button#type">Primary buttons</a> are common candidates for using this loader
1. <a href="/components/icon-button">Icon buttons</a> are less likely to use this loader but still necessary
   if the user needs to be informed of the action taking place

Use the loader for search inputs if it might take several seconds to perform the query.

![Example of dot loaders during search](figma:patterns-loaders-search-inputs.png)

Use the loader for <a href="/components/menu">Menus</a> where it might take several seconds to show information.

![Example of dot loaders in a menu](figma:patterns-loaders-menu.png)

### Progress

A <a href="/components/progress">Progress loader</a> communicates progress from 0 to 100% when downloading or
uploading content. The most common use for a progress loader is in the

<a href="/components/file-upload">File upload</a> component. Descriptive text is displayed to help clarify
what is in progress.

![Example of progress loaders in a File upload](figma:patterns-loaders-progress.png)

### Typing

The <a href="/components/inline">Inline loader</a> is used as a typing indicator. This signals the other party is
present and preparing a reply. The loader should be centered in the message bubble with other content
appearing above or below.

## Localization

### Right-to-left languages

Some loaders are direction-agnostic, which means that they are always positioned in the same place within the context,
and use the same direction for any animation elements. Dots and Spinner are examples of that.

Skeleton, Progress and Inline change direction for right-to-left languages. Skeleton animation and layout should change
direction. Progress loader should fill from the right (0) to the left (100%) side. Inline animation should change direction.

## Accessibility

Loaders have ARIA `role="progressbar"` applied to indicate the loading status. The `aria-live`, `alert`, or `status` role
is not added by default, but it can be extended on the component if needed. This should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis, depending on what part of the page is loading, the speed of loading on slower connections, and other live regions
on the page. Before, during, and after loading, browser focus should remain where the user put it.
