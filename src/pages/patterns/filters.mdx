## Overview
Filtering allows users to set specific parameters to reduce the amount of visible data in a dataset. There are two types of filters: basic filters and advanced filters. Basic filters allow users to make a few selections from predetermined parameters. Advanced filters allow users to set multiple filters; sometimes these filters are also configurable.

## General structure
Both basic and advanced filter patterns are made using the same basic building blocks: an entry point, a container, and selection methods.

## Formatting
### Entry point
![Filter pattern entry points](figma:filter-formatting-entry-points.png)
The Filter entry point is the [Button](/components/button) the user clicks to enter the Filter pattern.
* A [Default Button](/components/button) should be used to open an Advanced Filter.
* A [Media Button](/components/button) should be used to open a Basic Filter. 
* An [Icon Button](/components/button) should be used when the Filter pattern lives within a toolbar on the page, or to conserve UI space.
