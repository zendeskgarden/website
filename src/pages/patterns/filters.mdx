## Overview

Filtering allows users to set specific parameters to reduce the amount of visible data in a dataset.
There are two types of filters: basic filters and advanced filters. Basic filters allow users to make a
few selections from predetermined parameters. Advanced filters allow users to set multiple filters;
sometimes these filters are also configurable.

## General structure

Both basic and advanced filter patterns are made using the same basic building blocks: an entry point,
a container, and selection methods.

## Formatting

### Entry point

![Filter pattern entry points](figma:filter-formatting-entry-points.png)
The Filter entry point is the [Button](/components/button) the user clicks to enter the Filter pattern.

- A [Default Button](/components/button) should be used to open an Advanced Filter.
- A [Media Button](/components/button) should be used to open a Basic Filter.
- An [Icon Button](/components/button) should be used when the Filter pattern lives within a toolbar on the page,
  or to conserve UI space.

### Location and spacing

![Filter pattern location and spacing](figma:filter-formatting-location.png)

Filters are 20px below the page header and description.
The Search bar and filter button have 12px of padding between them.
Filters have 12px of padding below to allow space for Tags and 12px of space between the Tags and filter results.
The filter results are 12px above the table.

![Filter pattern icons](figma:filter-formatting-location-icons.png)

To save space in a view, an Icon Button in a toolbar can be used to open a Filter.
Include a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) to help any users who may be unfamiliar with the icon,
as well as a `title` attribute and `aria-label`.

### Surfacing filters and results

![Filter pattern surfacing tags](figma:filter-formatting-surfacing.png)

Filter parameters should be surfaced as [Tags](/components/tags) above the dataset they are filtering.
The Tag content contains the filter parameter category in Bold, followed by the user's selection in Regular weight.
The number of results after Filtering should be visible to users where possible.
The number of resulting data items should be displayed above the table below the filtering tags.
For guidance on formatting loading states, see our [Tables Basic Formatting pattern](/pattern/tables).

## Selection methods

Different components are used depending on the type of selections a user is making to filter their dataset.

## Usage

### Basic filtering

Basic Filters allow users to filter a dataset through one category with only a few options.

#### Single select

Single select basic filters use one selection to filter data. Upon the selection,
the Menu closes and the filter is surfaced as a Tag.
Selecting another menu option replaces the current Filter with the new selection.

![Filter pattern basic single select 1](figma:filter-usage-basic-singleselect-1.png)
![Filter pattern basic single select 2](figma:filter-usage-basic-singleselect-2.png)
![Filter pattern basic single select 3](figma:filter-usage-basic-singleselect-3.png)
![Filter pattern basic single select 4](figma:filter-usage-basic-singleselect-4.png)

#### Multiple selections

Multiple selection basic filters use multiple selections within a category to filter data.
The Menu remains open as the user makes their selections.
The selections are surfaced as Tags with a Basic Button to clear all filters.
