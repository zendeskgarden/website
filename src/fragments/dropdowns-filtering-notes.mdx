**Implementation notes**

<!-- markdownlint-enable no-emphasis-as-heading -->

- The dropdowns package does not have filtering logic. The simplest way to include filtering is to control
  the `inputValue` and `onInputValueChange` props, and conditionally render Item components as necessary.
- Use the `onInputValueChange` prop instead of or in combination with `onStateChange`, for more accurate IME
  (Input Method Editor) support
- There is a known [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-390386520) with
  Google Translate. As a workaround, wrap any conditionally rendered text node with a `span` element.
