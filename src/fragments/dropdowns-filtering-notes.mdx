**Implementation notes**

<!-- markdownlint-enable no-emphasis-as-heading -->

- The dropdowns package does not supply filtering logic. The simplest way to perform filtering is to control
  the `inputValue` and `onInputValueChange` props, and conditionally render Item components as necessary.
- Use input debouncing to delay Item rendering and prevent [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/)
  from reapplying accessibility and interaction attributes. See [examples](#how-to-use-it) for details.
- Due to a known [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-390386520) caused
  by Google Translate, any conditionally rendered text node should be wrapped with a `span` element.
