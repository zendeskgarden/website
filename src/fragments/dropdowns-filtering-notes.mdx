**Implementation notes**

<!-- markdownlint-enable no-emphasis-as-heading -->

- The dropdowns package does not supply filtering logic. The simplest way to perform filtering is to
  control the `inputValue` and `onInputValueChange` props, and conditionally render Item components as
  necessary.

- Use input debouncing to delay Item rendering and prevent Downshift from reapplying accessibility
  and interaction attributes.

- Due to a known [issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11538#issuecomment-390386520) caused
  by google translation extension, any conditionally rendered text node should be wrapped with a `span`
  element.
