The Dropdown component provides state and accessibility to its consumers while enabling customization.

**Placement / Positioning**: The Dropdown component uses [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/)
for positioning. Use the `popperModifiers` prop of the [Menu](#menu) component to customize the placement, boundaries,
overflows, etc.

**Dropdown State**: The [Downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) library handles
keyboard and accessibility logic. Provide other customizations directly to Downshift via
`downshiftProps`. See the [stateReducer](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statereducer) pattern
for a common customization strategy example.

**Server Side Rendering**: Server side rendering might require specific Downshift settings. The
dropdowns package re-exports Downshift's [resetIdCounter](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#resetidcounter)
utility, resetting the internal id counter which is used to generate unique ids for Downshift.
