The Dropdown component provides state and a11y through the context API to its consumers while enabling
customization.

**Placement / Positioning**: Internally, the Dropdown component uses [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/)
for positioning. Use the `popperModifiers` prop of the Menu component to customize the placement, boundaries,
overflows etc.

**Dropdown State**: The [Downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) `render-prop` library handles the
keyboard and accessibility logic. Provide other customizations directly to the Downshift provider via the
`downshiftProps` prop. See the [stateReducer](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#statereducer) pattern
for an example of a common customization strategy.

**Server Side Rendering**: Server side rendering might require configuring specific Downshift settings. The
package mentioned re-exports the Downshift `resetIdCounter` utility, resetting the internal id counter which
is used to generate unique ids for Downshift.
